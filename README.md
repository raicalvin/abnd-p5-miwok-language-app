# Android App: Miwok Translation App

## Project Information

### About

This project was developed in my Android Basics Nanodegree program from Udacity's Grow With Google Developer Scholarship. Users can swipe between tabs to access different categories, tap on words and phrases to hear the Miwok pronounciation, and learn some of the common words and phrases found in the Miwok language.

### Concepts

- ListViews and custom ArrayAdapters were used to populate fragments with custom layouts including the Miwok and English words and phrases
- Audio playback was controlled using an MediaPlayer class for each category, releasing media resources when necessary
- System audio focus was controlled using an AudioManager class for each category
- Fragments and ViewPagers were used to construct the tabbed UI layout
